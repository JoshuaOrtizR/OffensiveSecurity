**SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**

* **What it is:** SAST analyzes the source code of an application without actually running it. It examines the code for potential security vulnerabilities by comparing it against a set of rules and patterns.
* **How it works:** 
    * **Code Analysis:** SAST tools meticulously examine the source code, line by line, looking for security flaws. 
    * **Rule-Based:** They rely on pre-defined rules, patterns, and coding standards to identify potential weaknesses.
    * **Vulnerability Types:** Common vulnerabilities detected by SAST include:
        * **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user input in SQL queries.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
        * **Buffer Overflows:** Writing data beyond the allocated memory space.
        * **Race Conditions:** Concurrent access to shared resources leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Advantages:** 
    * **Early Detection:** Finds vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
    * **Cost-Effective:** Can identify and fix issues before they reach production, saving time and money.
    * **Automated:** Can be easily integrated into the development process.
* **Disadvantages:** 
    * **High False Positive Rate:** May generate many false alarms, requiring manual review.
    * **Limited Runtime Analysis:** Cannot detect vulnerabilities that only appear during runtime.
    * **Language-Specific:** Requires tools tailored to specific programming languages.

**DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

* **What it is:** DAST tests a running application from the outside, simulating attacks that a real hacker might attempt. 
* **How it works:**
    * **Black-Box Testing:** DAST tools interact with the application as an external user, sending requests and analyzing the responses.
    * **Vulnerability Types:** DAST excels at finding:
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
        * **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries.
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Tricking users into performing unintended actions.
        * **Authentication and Authorization Issues:** Weak passwords, improper access control.
* **Advantages:** 
    * **Real-World Testing:** Provides a more realistic assessment of application security.
    * **Identifies Runtime Issues:** Can detect vulnerabilities that only appear when the application is running.
    * **Language-Agnostic:** Can be used to test applications built with any programming language.
* **Disadvantages:** 
    * **Limited Code Coverage:** Cannot analyze internal code logic.
    * **Later Detection:** Vulnerabilities are identified later in the development cycle.
    * **May Miss Hidden Issues:** Difficult to find vulnerabilities that are not easily triggered.
