# Offensive Security

This section of my portfolio showcases a variety of real-world Penetration Testing & Bug Bounty Hunting. You'll find:

- SQL Injection: Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into web applications, potentially stealing data, modifying data, or even gaining server access.
- XXE (XML External Entity): Exploits vulnerabilities in XML processing to access internal files or even external systems.
- Server-Side Template Injection: Injecting malicious code into server-side templates, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Tricking users into performing actions on a website they are authenticated to, such as transferring funds or changing account settings.
- Clickjacking: Tricking users into clicking on hidden elements within a web page, leading them to perform unintended actions.
- Authentication: Weak or improperly implemented authentication mechanisms (passwords, tokens) can be easily compromised.
