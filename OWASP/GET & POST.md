The HTTP GET method is a fundamental way to request data from a web server. 

    *Primarily used to **retrieve data** from a specified resource on the server. 
    *It's designed to be **safe** and **idempotent**, meaning it shouldn't change the server's state and repeated requests should have the same effect.

    **URL Structure:** Parameters are included in the URL itself, following a question mark (?) and separated by ampersands (&). 
    **Example:** `https://www.example.com/api/users?page=1&limit=10`
    * **Data Transmission:** The data is transmitted as part of the URL.

* **Use Cases:**
    * **Fetching data:** Retrieving web pages, images, API responses, etc.
    * **Searching:** Filtering data based on parameters (e.g., searching for products by name).
    * **Browsing:** Navigating through web pages.

* **Limitations:**
    * **Security:** Since data is visible in the URL, it's not suitable for sensitive information like passwords or credit card details.
    * **URL Length:** There are limitations on the length of URLs, which can restrict the amount of data that can be transmitted.
    * **Caching:** GET requests are often cached by browsers and intermediaries, which can sometimes lead to stale data.

**Differences from POST:**

* **Data Location:** GET sends data in the URL, while POST sends data in the request body.
* **Security:** POST is generally considered more secure for sensitive data.
* **Side Effects:** GET should not have side effects on the server, while POST can modify server-side data.
