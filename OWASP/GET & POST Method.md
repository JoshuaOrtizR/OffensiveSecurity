**GET Method**

* **Purpose:** Primarily used to **retrieve data** from a server. 
* **Data Transmission:** 
    * Data is appended to the **URL** as **query parameters** (e.g., `?name=John&age=30`).
    * This makes the data visible in the URL itself.
* **Idempotency:** 
    * Idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. 
* **Caching:** 
    * GET requests are **cacheable** by default. 
* **Security:** 
    * **Less secure** than POST due to data exposure in the URL.
    * **Not suitable** for sensitive information.
* **Examples:**
    * Fetching a webpage (e.g., `https://www.udemy.com`)
    * Searching for products on an e-commerce site
    * Retrieving data from an API

**POST Method**

* **Purpose:** 
    * Used to **send data** to a server to **create or update** resources.
    * Can also trigger server-side actions like processing forms or uploading files.
* **Data Transmission:** 
    * Data is sent in the **request body** of the HTTP message.
    * Not visible in the URL.
* **Idempotency:** 
    * **Not idempotent.** 
    * Multiple identical POST requests may have different effects on the server.
* **Caching:** 
    * Generally **not cacheable** by default.
* **Security:** 
    * **More secure** than GET as data is not exposed in the URL.
* **Examples:**
    * Submitting a form (e.g., login, registration)
    * Uploading files
    * Creating new resources (e.g., adding a new user)

**Differences:**

| Feature | GET Method | POST Method |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Retrieve data | Send data, create/update resources |
| Data Location | URL | Request body |
| Visibility | Data visible in URL | Data not visible in URL |
| Idempotency | Idempotent | Not idempotent |
| Caching | Cacheable | Generally not cacheable |
| Security | Less secure | More secure |

**Choosing the Right Method:**

* **Use GET for:**
    * Retrieving data (e.g., fetching a webpage, searching)
    * Simple, non-sensitive operations
* **Use POST for:**
    * Submitting forms (login, registration)
    * Uploading files
    * Creating or updating resources
    * Sending sensitive data
