**Broken access control vulnerabilities**

Broken access control vulnerabilities arise when a system or application fails to properly restrict user interactions, allowing them to exceed their authorized privileges.

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
* **System compromise:** Ability to perform actions beyond permitted limits.

Common causes:

* **Authentication flaws:** Weak passwords, insufficient multi-factor authentication.
* **Authorization errors:** Incorrectly defined or enforced user roles and permissions.
* **Session management issues:** Vulnerable handling of user sessions.
* **Insecure direct object references:** Predictable IDs for resources.

The consequences of broken access control can be severe, including:

* **Data theft**
* **System disruption**
* **Reputational damage**
* **Financial losses**

To mitigate these risks, organizations must:

* **Implement strong authentication measures.**
* **Establish and enforce robust authorization controls.**
* **Securely manage user sessions.**
* **Validate and sanitize all user input.**
* **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.**

**Hands-on**

This practical example demonstrates a Broken Access Control vulnerability. We start with a scenario where a user is created with administrator privileges. 

**Manual Cookie Manipulation:**

1. We intercept the initial user login request using Burp Suite. 
2. We manually modify the cookie value associated with user privileges (e.g., changing "isAdmin": "false" to "isAdmin": "true"). 
3. We forward the modified request to the server. This grants the user unauthorized administrative access.

**Automated Cookie Manipulation:**

For automated exploitation, we can configure a rule within Burp Suite (e.g., using "Match and Replace"). This rule will automatically modify the target cookie value in all intercepted requests.
