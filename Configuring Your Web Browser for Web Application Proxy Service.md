**Configuring Your Web Browser for Web Application Proxy Service**

To effectively capture and analyze web traffic using Burp Suite, we'll need to configure your web browser to route traffic through a proxy server. 

**1. Open Your Web Browser:**
   - Launch your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

**2. Configure Proxy Settings:**
   - **HTTP Proxy:**
     - **Host:** Enter the IP address or hostname of your Burp Suite machine.
     - **Port:** Enter the port number where Burp Suite is listening (usually 8080).
   - **HTTPS Proxy:**
     - **Host:** Enter the same IP address or hostname as the HTTP proxy.
     - **Port:** Enter the same port number as the HTTP proxy.

**Once these settings are configured, all web traffic from your browser will be intercepted by Burp Suite, allowing you to inspect, modify, and analyze requests and responses.**
